Dashboard for [Analysis of Citi Bike (NYC)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hannah.s2782/viz/Module14Challenge_16647449313030/NYCStoryChallenge?publish=yes)

## Purpose: 
#### This project focuses on Citi Bike Data in New York City and analyizes key questions to provide an idea of what Citi Bike could do in Des Moines. 
Some questions that quickstarted analysis: 
* What is the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders?
* What is the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender?
* What is the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender?
* What is the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week?
* What is the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each type of user (customers vs. subscribers)?

## Results:
* The busiest ride times occur from 5:00pm to 7:00pm. 7:00am is another busy hour for rides.
* Typically, younger people take longer trips. 
* Most users will limit their trips to 20 minutes or less. 
* Weekdays between 5pm and 7pm result in the highest bike use. Except on Wednesdays, where data shows less bike use. 
* Subscribers use the bike service more often than non-subscribers. Male subscribers are the heaviest users, especially on Thursdays and Fridays.

Summary: 
Overall, Subscribers use the bike service more than regular customers. During the weekday, 7 am and 5-7 pm are the busiest times. The weekends vary on busy times and more consistantly used throughout the day. Wednesdays are the least busy day of the work week. The biggest customer base for Citi Bike is males who have subscriptions. Two more observation that could be made using the given data could be the number of each gender who are subscibers and a better visual using age to if more subscibers are younger or older.
